# AscendExaminer Installation Guide (Windows)

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up the AscendExaminer project on a Windows operating system.

⚠️ IMPORTANT! This guide is also self-generated by AI, so take it with a pinch of salt!


## Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js:** Install the latest LTS version of Node.js. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). npm (Node Package Manager) is included with Node.js.
2.  **Git:** (Recommended) Install Git for version control. Download it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).
3.  **PostgreSQL:** Install PostgreSQL. You can download it from [https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/). During installation, remember the username and password you set (the default is often 'postgres' for both). You will also need to create a database (e.g., `myapp`).

## Setup Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open Git Bash or Command Prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> AscendExaminer
    cd AscendExaminer
    ```
    Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your Git repository. If you downloaded the code as a ZIP file, extract it and navigate to the project folder in Command Prompt or PowerShell.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install the necessary Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    The application expects certain environment variables, particularly for the database connection. While the `npm run dev` script sets defaults, for a production-like setup or if you deviate from the defaults, you might need to set them manually or use a `.env` file (if the application is configured to use one). The key variables seen in `package.json` are:
    *   `DB_TYPE`: Set to `postgresql`
    *   `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string for your PostgreSQL database (e.g., `postgresql://your_user:your_password@localhost:5432/myapp`)

4.  **Database Migration:**
    Apply the database schema migrations. Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running and the database exists. Update the `DATABASE_URL` in the `package.json`'s `db:push` script if your credentials differ from the default `user:password`.
    ```bash
    npm run db:push
    ```
    *Note: This command uses the `DATABASE_URL` defined within the `scripts.db:push` section of `package.json`.*

5.  **Start the Development Server:**
    You can start the server in development mode using:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Alternatively, you can use the scripts created earlier:
    *   Double-click `start-dev-server.bat`
    *   Right-click `start-dev-server.ps1` and select "Run with PowerShell"
    *   Double-click the "Start Dev Server" shortcut on your Desktop.

    The server should now be running. Access the application as specified in the project's documentation or console output (likely involving a specific port on `localhost`).
